This is an authorised translation for KOL of the Tsniffer component by Umar Sear.
TSniffer is a packet capture component that uses the WinPcap packet capture library. You will need to download a recent version of winpcap from http://winpcap.polito.it/ for it to work.

For ease and convenience I have included the source file in this package.

To install the component extract the files to a suitable folder, install sniffer.pas from the source sub folder. You may need to update the search path so that Delphi can know where the DCU files for the component reside.

There are two demo apps, IPSnifferDemo and TCPSnifferDemo in the demo's folder. These should give an idea of what the component is capable of doing.

Please note this is a very early version of this component, as I have not done extensive testing with it.

Also note, althought the source is included in this package, this is not intended to be freeware.

Thanks
