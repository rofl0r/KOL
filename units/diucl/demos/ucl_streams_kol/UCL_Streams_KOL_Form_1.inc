 + 'oftware or use pieces of it'+#13+#10+'in new free programs; and that you know you can do '
 + 'these things.'+#13+#10+#13+#10+'  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that for'

 + 'e copies of such a program, whether'+#13+#10+'gratis or for a fee, you must give the reci'
 + 'pients all the rights that'+#13+#10+'you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receiv'

 + 'stributed'+#13+#10+'under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below'
 + ','+#13+#10+'refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"'+#13+#10+'means '

 + 'a work containing the Program or a portion of it,'+#13+#10+'either verbatim or with modif'
 + 'ications and/or translated into another'+#13+#10+'language.  (Hereinafter, translation is'
 + ' included without limitation in'+#13+#10+'the term "modification".)  Each licensee is add'
 + 'ressed as "you".'+#13+#10+#13+#10+'Activities other than copying, distribution and modification'
 + ' are not'+#13+#10+'covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of'+#13+#10+'runn'

 + 'nly if its contents constitute a work based on the'+#13+#10+'Program (independent of havi'
 + 'ng been made by running the Program).'+#13+#10+'Whether that is true depends on what the '
 + 'Program does.'+#13+#10+#13+#10+'  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program'
 + '''s'+#13+#10+'source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you'+#13+#10+'conspicuous'
 + 'ly and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate'+#13+#10+'copyright notice and d'
 + 'isclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the'+#13+#10+'notices that refer to this License a'
 + 'nd to the absence of any warranty;'+#13+#10+'and give any other recipients of the Program'
 + ' a copy of this License'+#13+#10+'along with the Program.'+#13+#10+#13+#10+'You may charge a fee for the'
 + ' physical act of transferring a copy, and'+#13+#10+'you may at your option offer warranty'
 + ' protection in exchange for a fee.'+#13+#10+#13+#10+'  2. You may modify your copy or copies of'
 + ' the Program or any portion'+#13+#10+'of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, an'
 + 'd copy and'+#13+#10+'distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1'+#13+#10
 + 'above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:'+#13+#10+#13+#10+'    a) You must c'
 + 'ause the modified files to carry prominent notices'+#13+#10+'    stating that you changed'
 + ' the files and the date of any change.'+#13+#10+#13+#10+'    b) You must cause any work that yo'
 + 'u distribute or publish, that in'+#13+#10+'    whole or in part contains or is derived fr'
 + 'om the Program or any'+#13+#10+'    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge '
 + 'to all third'+#13+#10+'    parties under the terms of this License.'+#13+#10+#13+#10+'    c) If the modi'
 + 'fied program normally reads commands interactively'+#13+#10+'    when run, you must cause'
 + ' it, when started running for such'+#13+#10+'    interactive use in the most ordinary way'
 + ', to print or display an'+#13+#10+'    announcement including an appropriate copyright no'
 + 'tice and a'+#13+#10+'    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provi'
 + 'de'+#13+#10+'    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under'+#13+#10+'    these'
 + ' conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this'+#13+#10+'    License.  (Exc'
 + 'eption: if the Program itself is interactive but'+#13+#10+'    does not normally print su'
 + 'ch an announcement, your work based on'+#13+#10+'    the Program is not required to print'
 + ' an announcement.)'+#13+#10+#12+#13+#10+'These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.'
 + '  If'+#13+#10+'identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,'+#13+#10+'and '
 + 'can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in'+#13+#10+'themselves, then'
 + ' this License, and its terms, do not apply to those'+#13+#10+'sections when you distribut'
 + 'e them as separate works.  But when you'+#13+#10+'distribute the same sections as part of'
 + ' a whole which is a work based'+#13+#10+'on the Program, the distribution of the whole mu'
 + 'st be on the terms of'+#13+#10+'this License, whose permissions for other licensees exten'
 + 'd to the'+#13+#10+'entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote '
 + 'it.'+#13+#10+#13+#10+'Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest'+#13+#10+'yo'
 + 'ur rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to'+#13+#10+'exercise th'
 + 'e right to control the distribution of derivative or'+#13+#10+'collective works based on '
 + 'the Program.'+#13+#10+#13+#10+'In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the P'
 + 'rogram'+#13+#10+'with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of'+#13+#10+'a'
 + ' storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under'+#13+#10+'the scope o'
 + 'f this License.'+#13+#10+#13+#10+'  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based'
 + ' on it,'+#13+#10+'under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of'+#13+#10
 + 'Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:'+#13+#10+#13+#10+'    a)'
 + ' Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable'+#13+#10+'    source code,'
 + ' which must be distributed under the terms of Sections'+#13+#10+'    1 and 2 above on a m'
 + 'edium customarily used for software interchange; or,'+#13+#10+#13+#10+'    b) Accompany it with'
 + ' a written offer, valid for at least three'+#13+#10+'    years, to give any third party, '
 + 'for a charge no more than your'+#13+#10+'    cost of physically performing source distrib'

 + 'o be'+#13+#10+'    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium'+#13+#10+'   '
 + ' customarily used for software interchange; or,'+#13+#10+#13+#10+'    c) Accompany it with the '
 + 'information you received as to the offer'+#13+#10+'    to distribute corresponding source'
 + ' code.  (This alternative is'+#13+#10+'    allowed only for noncommercial distribution an'
 + 'd only if you'+#13+#10+'    received the program in object code or executable form with s'
 + 'uch'+#13+#10+'    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)'+#13+#10+#13+#10+'The source code for a '
 + 'work means the preferred form of the work for'+#13+#10+'making modifications to it.  For '
 + 'an executable work, complete source'+#13+#10+'code means all the source code for all modu'
 + 'les it contains, plus any'+#13+#10+'associated interface definition files, plus the scrip'

 + 'ponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the'+#13+#10+'operating system on which the exec'
 + 'utable runs, unless that component'+#13+#10+'itself accompanies the executable.'+#13+#10+#13+#10+'If dis'
 + 'tribution of executable or object code is made by offering'+#13+#10+'access to copy from '
 + 'a designated place, then offering equivalent'+#13+#10+'access to copy the source code fro'
 + 'm the same place counts as'+#13+#10+'distribution of the source code, even though third p'
 + 'arties are not'+#13+#10+'compelled to copy the source along with the object code.'+#13+#10+#12+#13+#10+'  4'
 + '. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program'+#13+#10+'except as exp'
 + 'ressly provided under this License.  Any attempt'+#13+#10+'otherwise to copy, modify, sub'
 + 'license or distribute the Program is'+#13+#10+'void, and will automatically terminate you'
 + 'r rights under this License.'+#13+#10+'However, parties who have received copies, or righ'
 + 'ts, from you under'+#13+#10+'this License will not have their licenses terminated so long'
 + ' as such'+#13+#10+'parties remain in full compliance.'+#13+#10+#13+#10+'  5. You are not required to acc'
 + 'ept this License, since you have not'+#13+#10+'signed it.  However, nothing else grants y'
 + 'ou permission to modify or'+#13+#10+'distribute the Program or its derivative works.  The'
 + 'se actions are'+#13+#10+'prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,'
 + ' by'+#13+#10+'modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the'+#13+#10+'Program), '
 + 'you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and'+#13+#10+'all its terms and co'
 + 'nditions for copying, distributing or modifying'+#13+#10+'the Program or works based on i'
 + 't.'+#13+#10+#13+#10+'  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the'+#13+#10+'Pro'
 + 'gram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the'+#13+#10+'original licenso'
 + 'r to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to'+#13+#10+'these terms and conditio'
 + 'ns.  You may not impose any further'+#13+#10+'restrictions on the recipients'' exercise of'
 + ' the rights granted herein.'+#13+#10+'You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by'
 + ' third parties to'+#13+#10+'this License.'+#13+#10+#13+#10+'  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgmen'
 + 't or allegation of patent'+#13+#10+'infringement or for any other reason (not limited to '
 + 'patent issues),'+#13+#10+'conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreemen'
 + 't or'+#13+#10+'otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not'+#13+#10+'ex'
 + 'cuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot'+#13+#10+'distribute so as t'
 + 'o satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this'+#13+#10+'License and any other pert'
 + 'inent obligations, then as a consequence you'+#13+#10+'may not distribute the Program at '
 + 'all.  For example, if a patent'+#13+#10+'license would not permit royalty-free redistribu'
 + 'tion of the Program by'+#13+#10+'all those who receive copies directly or indirectly thro'
 + 'ugh you, then'+#13+#10+'the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be '
 + 'to'+#13+#10+'refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.'+#13+#10+#13+#10+'If any portion of this'
 + ' section is held invalid or unenforceable under'+#13+#10+'any particular circumstance, th'
 + 'e balance of the section is intended to'+#13+#10+'apply and the section as a whole is int'
 + 'ended to apply in other'+#13+#10+'circumstances.'+#13+#10+#13+#10+'It is not the purpose of this section'
 + ' to induce you to infringe any'+#13+#10+'patents or other property right claims or to con'
 + 'test validity of any'+#13+#10+'such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecti'
 + 'ng the'+#13+#10+'integrity of the free software distribution system, which is'+#13+#10+'implemente'
 + 'd by public license practices.  Many people have made'+#13+#10+'generous contributions to'
 + ' the wide range of software distributed'+#13+#10+'through that system in reliance on cons'
 + 'istent application of that'+#13+#10+'system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he'
 + ' or she is willing'+#13+#10+'to distribute software through any other system and a licens'
 + 'ee cannot'+#13+#10+'impose that choice.'+#13+#10+#13+#10+'This section is intended to make thoroughly cl'
 + 'ear what is believed to'+#13+#10+'be a consequence of the rest of this License.'+#13+#10+#12+#13+#10+'  8. '
 + 'If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in'+#13+#10+'certain countrie'
 + 's either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the'+#13+#10+'original copyright holder'
 + ' who places the Program under this License'+#13+#10+'may add an explicit geographical dis'

 + 'choose any version ever published by the Free Software'+#13+#10+'Foundation.'+#13+#10+#13+#10+'  10. If '
 + 'you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free'+#13+#10+'programs whose dis'

 + ' For software which is copyrighted by the Free'+#13+#10+'Software Foundation, write to th'
