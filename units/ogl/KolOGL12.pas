unit KolOGL12;

{----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This is an interface unit for the use of OpenGL from within Delphi and contains
  the translations of gl.h, glu.h as well as some support functions.
  OpenGL12.pas contains bug fixes and enhancements of Delphi's and other translations
  as well as support for extensions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This translation is based on OpenGL12.pas source:

 All modifications applyed for minimization code.

 [-] All Code Translated for using with KOL
        KOL - Key Objects Library (C) 2000 by Kladov Vladimir.

        Home: http://www.angelfire.com/home/kol/index.htm
 [-] All base OGL methods translated for auto initialization code
 [+] procedure InitGLExtensions;
        This procedure allow call ReadExtensions from ActivateRenderingContext
        if a new pixel format is used, but you can safely call it from where you want
        to actualize those values (under the condition that a rendering context MUST be active).
 [-] All variables for checking availability of Extensions
        - translated to Functions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 function InitOpenGL: Boolean;
   Needed to load the OpenGL DLLs and all addresses of the standard functions.
   In case OpenGL is already initialized this function does nothing. No error
   is raised, if something goes wrong, but you need to inspect the result in order
   to know if all went okay.
   RESULT: True if successful or already loaded, False otherwise

 function InitOpenGLFromLibrary(GL_Name, GLU_Name: String): Boolean;
   Same as InitOpenGL, but you can specify specific DLLs. Useful if you want to
   use different DLLs then those of Windows. This function closes eventually
   loaded DLLs before it tries to open the newly given.
   RESULT: True if successful, False otherwise

 procedure CloseOpenGL;
   Unloads the OpenGL DLLs and sets all function addresses to nil, including
   extensions. You can load and unload the DLLs as often as you like.

 function  CreateRenderingContext(DC: HDC; Options: TRCOptions; ColorBits, StencilBits, AccumBits, AuxBuffers: Integer;
   Layer: Integer): HGLRC;
   Sets up a pixel format and creates a new rendering context depending of the
   given parameters:
     DC          - the device context for which the rc is to be created
     Options     - options for the context, which the application would like to have
                   (it is not guaranteed they will be available)
     ColorBits   - the color depth of the device context (Note: Because of the internal DC handling of the VCL you
                   should avoid using GetDeviceCaps for memory DCs which are members of a TBitmap class.
                   Translate the Pixelformat member instead!)
     StencilBits - requested size of the stencil buffer
     AccumBits   - requested size of the accumulation buffer
     AuxBuffers  - requested number of auxiliary buffers
     Layer       - ID for the layer for which the RC will be created (-1..-15 for underlay planes, 0 for main plane,
                   1..15 for overlay planes)
                   Note: The layer handling is not yet complete as there is very few information
                   available and (until now) no OpenGL implementation with layer support on the low budget market.
                   Hence use 0 (for the main plane) as layer ID.
   RESULT: the newly created context or 0 if setup failed

 procedure ActivateRenderingContext(DC: HDC; RC: HGLRC);
   Makes RC in DC 'current' (wglMakeCurrent(..)) and loads all extension addresses
   and flags if necessary.

 procedure DeactivateRenderingContext;
   Counterpart to ActivateRenderingContext.

 procedure DestroyRenderingContext(RC: HGLRC);
   RC will be destroyed and must be recreated if you want to use it again.

 procedure ReadExtensions;
   Determines which extensions for the current rendering context are available and
   loads their addresses. This procedure is called from ActivateRenderingContext
 * (InitGLExtensions must be called before ActivateRenderingContext)
   if a new pixel format is used, but you can safely call it from where you want
   to actualize those values (under the condition that a rendering context MUST be
   active).

 procedure ReadImplementationProperties;
   Determines other properties of the OpenGL DLL (version, availability of extensions).
   Again, a valid rendering context must be active.
